# Classwork on using decomposition to break up your component classes

We will reconstruct the ToDo application and use decomposition to use a separate todo widget class to render the items in the list

* We will use the backend server at this location: https://github.com/Kevin-CodeCrew/code-school-nodejs-todo-backend.git
* First use 'npm install' to install required modules, then verify the database credentials
* Start the server with 'npm start' and access the endpoint http://localhost:3001/api/setuptodos to create some test records

* Use the partially decomposed project during review to decomposition techniques
* Ensure client application operates as expected
* For the graded part of the classwork, decompose the header portion of the application into it's own module and work out how to pass in any required proerties (e.g. app title)
* Once complete, check-in and push everything to this repository
